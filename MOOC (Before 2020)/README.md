## Duke

In the Duke folder, you could see how I utilised the data from BRFSS to determine the issues and developed the insights of data with R. Also, the file "Tableau Visualisation.pdf" shows my Tableau project to visualise the effectiveness of free-trial marketing events and suggestions.

## Imperial

The files are related to my study and practices about algorithms and machine learning with Python through several modules of ICL. 

## UC Davis

In the folder - UC Davis, I analysed the dataset of Yelp to identify the correlation between hotel rating and facilities with SQL.
