## Excel

### Excel Solver

"Excel Solver" demonstrates how I analysed and applied the question to Excel Solver to solve business problems. 

### SVM_3-Fold CrossValidation

By applying the algorithms of Support Vector Machine (SVM), I successfully reproduce the SVM model with Excel and tune the model with 3 fold cross-validation.

## R

### Visualisation Dashboard with Auto-collecting Data_R

I parsed the data through Food Standards Agency automatically through "Web Crawler (Parse Data From Food Hygiene Agency).Rmd" and visualised the data with maps, tables, and other manipulable figures in "shiny.R".

### Handling Unbalanced Panel (Combining Several Unstructured Datasets)_R

I manipulated dozens of files across different folders to combine and transform the formats into a consistent file.

### Customer Churn Prediction_R

I followed the CRISP-DM to preprocess, build, and evaluate the data and machine learning models, including SVM, logistic regression, random forest, and so on, to predict the customer churn.

### Examine whether new store layout increases the sales_R

I utilised statistics to examine whether the new layout and other indicators of the store could affect sales.

## Simul8

I utilised Simul8 to build two models to simulate a walk-in clinic and examine whether the new configuration could increase the efficiency of the clinic to reduce the waiting time of patients. 

## SPSS

I used Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensions of the dataset, grouped the related variables with Factor Analysis, then developed insights of each group with Cluster Analysis for StarCraft II gamers.

## SQL

I designed the whole database with ER diagram and created the SQL tables according to the design and solved several business problems.
